# This file contains the code 

here i am creating a package that will be made available with my next publication. The package is inside the jupyter notebook, named display_2d_map. 

This package takes in Rg2 and Ree2 data for a protein or polymer chain, and can plot the conformational ensemble as a map for that polymer/protein. The 2d conformational map shows a scatter plot in terms of polymer shape and size.
